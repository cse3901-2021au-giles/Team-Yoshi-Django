## Notes

1. Due to the time limit of presentation, the team does not include all the material in the slides. In the slides, there are only two quiz questions about Django. However, in this repo, several different problems that cover different levels of Bloom's taxonomy are included in "Assessment Questions.pdf".

2. This repo also contains a very useful Django cheat sheet that can not be explained in detail during the presentation. The team decided to put the whole Django cheat sheet in this repo so that people can feel free to look it up.
